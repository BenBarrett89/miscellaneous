## Muting

- muted strums between chords in a progression or using muting to lightly damp the chords themselves to create intricate funky rhythmic rhythm guitar parts (If You Have to Ask)
- something he often does when playing single-note lines. He uses the other fingers of his fretting hand to mute the five strings not being played, meaning he can be ‘strum’ the single note - ie, he plays all six strings, but only the relevant one note sounds because the other five strings are muted. This process enables the single-note lines to be played with more conviction and attack (Can’t Stop and Scar Tissue)
- famous for the percussive 16th-note muting he applied to many of his progressions

## Rhythm

- One of the defining elements in John's style is his use of hard, staccato funk rhythm guitar riffs
  - When playing in this style, I get a real percussive, funky sound by barely pressing down on the strings. The idea with James Brown's music is to make the guitar more like a time-keeping percussion instrument. That kind of playing places the emphasis on being very precise with the picking hand and staying deep in the groove. On a Strat, it's also good to use the bridge pickup in order to get a sharper sound and attack.

## Rhythmic embellishments

- A perfect example is the second verse of Under The Bridge, where an otherwise simple chord progression is embellished and played with fills.
- An example from Jimi Hendrix would be Little Wing
- Key to this style is sliding in and out of chords, using fills and embellishments to create a blend of rhythm and lead guitar that is both thoroughly interesting and does a fantastic job of filling a soundscape that could otherwise be a little bare in a band line-up containing only one guitarist
- The perfect place to begin is with either of the songs mentioned above. Break down the component parts into individual phrases if you need to understand the style or technically get a grip on these ideas.

## Playing intervals

- the playing of essential intervals of a chord rather than the full voicing, ie, plucking or strumming just a chord’s root and 3rd to create a more reserved melodic version than simply strumming the full barre chord (Scar Tissue)
- The important thing here is to know within any chord shape which note is the root, which note is the 3rd, which is the 5th and so on

## Melody

- showcase his clean, precise chord work interspersed with deliberately 'naïve' sounding melodies, contrasting with full-blown Hendrix style lead workouts.
- use of two-note, chord/melody-type parts, whereby you'll pick bass notes on a low string with your thumb while fingerpicking a syncopated melodic figure above it on higher strings

## Scale Choice

- This kind of lick could be expanded upon considerably if you know the minor pentatonic scale across the neck.
- the roots of his soloing style are found in the blues and pentatonic scales, his unique and expressive phrasing is what sets him apart from most other players
  - You can't forget that it's all about playing music. It's not about what you can show people you can do with a piece of wood with strings on it; the idea is to make sounds that are good, and in music, that has everything to do the relationships between the different elements
- Pentatonic and minor scale soloing
- soloing style is half-drawn from the rock/blues soloing of legends like Hendrix and Page, and half-influenced by the modern electronic music Frusciante loves
- best thing to do is to learn solos and licks to build up your vocabulary in that style. I would suggest starting with some of his live solos
- just like Jimi Hendrix, involves a lot of playing with CAGED chord shapes using hammer-ons and pull-offs which incorporate scale tones. John also tended to favor bold simple majors and minors most of the time when he did rhythm work

## Chord Choice and Voicing

- heavy use of the extended dominant chords utilized in funk, often making use of voicings limited to the top three strings for a distinctive funky sound
- one of the most used chord is his progressions is the dominant 9th, which is also the most frequently appearing chord in most funk music.
- use of two-note, chord/melody-type parts, whereby you'll pick bass notes on a low string with your thumb while fingerpicking a syncopated melodic figure above it on higher strings
- John also tended to favor bold simple majors and minors most of the time when he did rhythm work

## Embellishment / Ornamentation

- remember not to add lots of typical 'guitarisms' like bends and wide vibrato because this defeats the object.
- this is a great example of John's more fiery side. String bends, gentle vibrato and long slides are all in evidence.
- distinct approach to soloing is manifested in the way he usually emphasizes melody over any flashy technical playing
- a lot of playing with CAGED chord shapes using hammer-ons and pull-offs which incorporate scale tones

## Pedals

- Wah Pedal made Frusciante’s leads extremely expressive, especially when used on speedier licks, such as the fast final flurry in Dani California
- Using fuzz/distortion and a slapback echo, this is a great example of John's more fiery side

## Overdubs

- Whether it's with a loop pedal or recording software, layering and overdubbing parts is something you should practice. It's great fun, it teaches you about arranging and harmony and it opens up many potential creative opportunities.
