# bjorklund
An attempt at a JavaScript implementation of the Bjorklund Algorithm which I found in the paper [The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) by Godfried Toussaint.

The algorithm is originally presented in [The Theory of Rep-Rate Pattern Generation in the SNS Timing Systems](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c652/d0a32895afc5d50b6527447824c31a553659.pdf) by E. Bjorklund.

As an aside, Toussaint's website, [Rhythm and Mathematics](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/rhythm-and-mathematics.html) contains many more papers and references in surrounding topics.
